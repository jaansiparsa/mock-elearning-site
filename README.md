# Brex-MVP - T3 App with Basic Authentication

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app` and configured with basic username/password authentication.

## Features

- **Basic Authentication**: Username/password login system (no OAuth)
- **User Registration**: Sign up with email and password
- **Secure Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- **Protected Routes**: Dashboard page requires authentication
- **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and responsive design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL="file:./db.sqlite"
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
   NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   ```

   You can generate a secret key with:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```

4. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up**: Visit `/auth/signup` to create a new account
2. **Sign In**: Visit `/auth/signin` to log in with your credentials
3. **Dashboard**: Once logged in, visit `/dashboard` to see your account information
4. **Sign Out**: Use the sign out button to log out

### Pages

- `/` - Home page with authentication status
- `/auth/signin` - Sign in page
- `/auth/signup` - Sign up page
- `/dashboard` - Protected dashboard (requires authentication)
